## PROBLEM: 
Organizations often struggle to manage employee data efficiently due to fragmented systems and manual processes. This leads to errors in payroll, difficulty in tracking employee performance, leave management issues, and lack of actionable insights for decision-making.


## SOLUTION: 
There is a need for a centralized system that can store, manage, and analyze employee-related data such as job roles, salaries, qualifications, and attendance.


## Objectives
- Design a structured relational database
- Maintain data integrity using keys and constraints
- Perform employee, department, and salary analysis
- Answer real-world HR business questions using SQL

##  Database Schema
The database consists of the following tables:

- **SalaryBonus** – Manages salary and bonus details  
- **Payroll** – Tracks payroll records and salary calculations  
- **Leaves** – Stores employee leave information  
- **Qualification** – Maintains employee qualifications and positions  

All tables are connected using **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys** to ensure referential integrity.
